a = 5
b = a + 5
c = b + 5
d = c + 5
a = d - 15

print(a,b,c,d)
# prints 5, 10, 15, 20

b = 20

print(a,b,c,d)
# prints 5, 20, 15, 20
# but expected -> 15, 20, 25, 30

## my intension was to declare the variables such that whenever i change one of them all others get changed accordingly(eg; when b turns to 20, c becomes 25, d becomes 30 and a becomes 15)... thats why i declared them in a circular manner... but it didnt workout... since all variables' values were worked out to constants implicitly by the computer(eg; b = a + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10)... i want some way to declare the variables such that whenever i change one of them all others should get changed accordingly...
